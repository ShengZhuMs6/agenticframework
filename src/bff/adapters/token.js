 * RUNNING THE AZURE CLI FROM NODE ON WINDOWS — two separate traps, and they

 *
 * 1. There is no `az.exe`. The Azure CLI installs as `az.cmd`, a batch wrapper
 *    around Python. `execFile` does not go through a shell and does not apply
 *    PATHEXT, so asking it for `az` produces `spawn az ENOENT` — which reads
 *    like the CLI is missing when it is on PATH and works from the same prompt.
 *
 * 2. Naming `az.cmd` explicitly then hits the OTHER wall. Since the fix for
 *    CVE-2024-27980 ("BatBadBut") in Node 18.20.2 / 20.12.2 / 21.7.3 and every
 *    release after, Node refuses to spawn a `.bat` or `.cmd` without
 *    `shell: true` and fails with `spawn EINVAL`. There is no way around it:
 *    for a `.cmd`, a shell is now mandatory.
 *
 * So `shell: true` — but only on Windows, only for the batch wrappers, and
 * only with the one variable argument strictly validated first (see
 * assertSafeResource). Node's own advisory draws exactly this distinction: the
 * shell option is appropriate when the input reaching it is sanitised. On
 * Linux and macOS `az` is a real executable and no shell is involved at all.
