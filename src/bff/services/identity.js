/**
 * Identity — real Microsoft Entra sign-in.
 *
 * Container Apps built-in authentication (Easy Auth) terminates the sign-in
 * before the request reaches this process, and injects the result as headers.
 * There is no auth code here, no token validation, no secret: the platform has
 * already done it, and the container is not reachable except through the
 * ingress that performs it.
 *
 *   x-ms-client-principal-name   the user's UPN
 *   x-ms-client-principal-id     their object id
 *   x-ms-client-principal        base64 JSON of every claim, including groups
 *
 * GROUPS ARE THE WHOLE GOVERNANCE MODEL.
 * Every visibility decision is made against the user's Entra group membership,
 * so the app registration MUST emit a groups claim. Without it every user
 * looks like a member of nothing, and the Marketplace correctly — but
 * uselessly — shows them almost nothing. See docs for the token configuration
 * step; it is the single most common reason a live deployment looks broken.
 *
 * DEFAULT GROUPS. Anyone who has signed in is, by definition, a member of
 * staff — so CORTEX_DEFAULT_GROUPS (default `all-staff`) is granted to every
 * authenticated user on top of whatever Entra says. This is what lets a PoC
 * tenant with no group mapping render "Open to all staff" entries as available
 * rather than as "Licence does not cover you". Team-scoped and cleared groups
 * still come only from Entra. Set it empty to turn the default off.
