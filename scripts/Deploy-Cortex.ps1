.SYNOPSIS
  Deploy Cortex to Azure, reusing your existing estate. Safe to run repeatedly.

.DESCRIPTION
  Probes each Azure resource Cortex needs. Where it exists, Cortex is granted
  access to it. Where it does not, Cortex creates it. Nothing you already own
  is recreated or reconfigured beyond the role assignment Cortex needs.

  Defaults point at subscription ME-MngEnvMCAP181916-Core:
    API Management  prdcoreapimneu001        (PRDCOREAPIM001, North Europe)
    Purview         prdcorepurvieweus        (PRDCOREPVW001,  East US)
    Foundry         prdcorefdryeus001        (PRDCOREFDRY001, East US)
    Key Vault       prdcorekveus             (PRDCOREPVW001,  East US)
    Registry        prdcoreamlacr001         (PRDCOREAML001,  North Europe)
    Monitoring      prdcoreamlneu08774392429 (PRDCOREAML001,  North Europe)

  BUILT FOR REPEATED RUNS
  Every step is idempotent and the script pre-flights the things that have
  actually broken a run here:

    * Model version. An unpinned model resolves to whatever ARM currently
      defaults to. gpt-4o-mini's default moved to 2024-07-18, which is
      Deprecated, and Azure refuses new deployments of it. The script now
      verifies the requested model AND version are offered by the account and
      are not deprecating, and tells you what to switch to when they are.
    * Container images. `azd up` provisions then deploys, so provisioning used
      to reset both apps to the placeholder image on every run. The image
      currently running is read back and fed into the template.
    * Resource group location. A group's location is immutable; the live one
      is read and reused so a changed -Location cannot wedge the deployment.
    * Key Vault. Seeding is skipped rather than failing the whole deployment
      when you lack Secrets Officer, and the vault's current owning
      environment is checked before it is taken over.
    * Soft-deleted names. Checked and recovered before a create is attempted,
      which is the real cause of "a resource with this name already exists or
      is in a conflicting state".

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\Deploy-Cortex.ps1
  Reuse everything that exists, create only what does not.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\Deploy-Cortex.ps1 -WhatIfResources
  Report what would be reused, created and changed. Changes nothing.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\Deploy-Cortex.ps1 -AppOnly
  Rebuild and push the container images only. No infrastructure, no bootstrap.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\Deploy-Cortex.ps1 -UpgradeModel
  Move an existing model deployment onto the pinned model and version.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\Deploy-Cortex.ps1 -GroupMap 'operations=Operations'
  Full deployment, and map an Entra group onto the name the access rules use.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\Deploy-Cortex.ps1 -DemoIdentities -DemoUserEmail colleague@defra.gov.uk
  Full deployment, plus the "same page, different eyes" set-up: the demo Entra
  groups are created and mapped, you are put in all of them, and the colleague
  is invited into the analysts group only.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\Deploy-Cortex.ps1 -NoPerimeter
  Leave the storage accounts on their own network rules instead of inside the
  Network Security Perimeter. Only sensible in a tenant without the SFI
  storage policy; in this one the accounts are then closed by policy.

.EXAMPLE
  .\scripts\Deploy-Cortex.ps1 -Reset
  Delete everything Cortex created and start clean. Prompts first.

  #
  # WHERE THE APIM KEY GOES, AND WHY IT IS NOT A BICEP PARAMETER.
  #
  # Reading the key is a control-plane call against API Management, so it works
  # regardless of the Key Vault firewall. Writing it is the part that has to
  # adapt:
  #
  #   Key Vault mode — write it to the vault, as before.
  #   Direct mode    — write it as a Container Apps secret on cortex-web.
  #
  # It is set here rather than passed through Bicep on purpose. azd sources
  # template parameters from .azure/<env>/.env, so a credential passed that way
  # is written to disk in plaintext. Setting it on the app afterwards keeps it
  # out of the repo, out of the azd environment file, and out of the deployment
  # history.
  #
  # The cost of that choice: a bare `azd provision` that bypasses this script
  # may drop the secret. That is why this step runs on every deployment and
  # re-asserts it, and why it is cheap to re-run.
