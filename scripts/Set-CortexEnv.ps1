.SYNOPSIS
  Load the Cortex configuration into THIS PowerShell session.

.DESCRIPTION
  DOT-SOURCE THIS. `.\scripts\Set-CortexEnv.ps1` runs in its own scope and the
  variables vanish when it exits — the leading dot is what makes them stick:

      . .\scripts\Set-CortexEnv.ps1

  WHY THIS EXISTS
  bootstrap.js reads configuration exactly the way the app does: Key Vault
  first, environment variables second. That worked when the vault was readable
  from your machine. It is not — public network access is disabled, and the
  Key Vault firewall applies to the data plane, which is what a read is.

  The deployed container apps are fine: provisioning writes their configuration
  directly onto them. But `npm run bootstrap` runs HERE, on your laptop, in a
  process that has neither the vault nor those environment variables. So every
  required value resolves to nothing and bootstrap exits with:

      Missing required configuration:
        - azure-subscription-id
        ... (the 8 entries marked required in SECRET_CATALOGUE)

  This script closes that gap. It reads what provisioning already published
  into the azd environment, fetches the APIM subscription key from API
  Management's ARM endpoint — a control-plane call, so the Key Vault firewall
  is irrelevant to it — and sets both as environment variables for this
  session only.

  NOTHING IS WRITTEN TO DISK. The APIM key lives in this session's memory and
  disappears when you close the window. That is deliberate: a .env file
  containing it would be a credential sitting in your repo folder.

.EXAMPLE
  . .\scripts\Set-CortexEnv.ps1
  npm run bootstrap

.EXAMPLE
  . .\scripts\Set-CortexEnv.ps1 -Quiet
  Same, without the summary.
